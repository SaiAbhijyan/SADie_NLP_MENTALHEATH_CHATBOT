SADie: A cutting-edge generative hybrid support chatbot aimed at providing empathetic and effective mental health support. 

This project demonstrates my commitment to utilizing advanced technology for the betterment of society.
Hybrid Model Fusion: As we orchestrated the integration of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
architectures within SADie's design. This has resulted in a groundbreaking hybrid model that leverages the unique strengths of both
frameworks to enhance conversational capabilities.
Empathetic Conversational AI: While focusing to finetune SADie to not only provide accurate and contextually relevant responses but
also to exhibit empathetic communication. We have showcased a profound understanding of the specific challenges associated with
mental health support and the significance of a compassionate AI interface.
Strategic Technological Synergy: As the model was being developed we implemented a strategic technological synergy by employing
both LSTM and GRU in the design of SADie. This approach has led to an improved conversational flow, enhanced response generation,
and an overall superior user experience in the field of mental health support.

##This was a team project as a part of our academics while working with Natural Language Processing.
